  ## Hi, I'm Jason and I like turning ðŸ“ˆ into ðŸ’Ž

"_Sometimes I VLOOKUP at the * s to find a scatterplot staring back at me._"

I'm interested in data and how it can help us in our day to day; whether its finding a faster route to work, tracking monthly spend on take out delivery services or using historical and geographical data to understand house prices in a record-breaking market to make an informed decision.

This website serves as a portfolio to track my development while also storing some personal projects I complete in my spare time.
