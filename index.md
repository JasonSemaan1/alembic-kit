  ## Hi, I'm Jason and I like turning ðŸ“ˆ into ðŸ’Ž

Sometimes I VLOOKUP at the * s to find a scatterplot staring back at me.
I'm interested in data and how it can help us whether through optimisating existing processes, solving complex problems or assisting in understanding ones' self.
This website serves as a portfolio to track my development while also storing some personal projects I complete in my spare time.

If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to email me at Jason.Semaan1@gmail.com
